      <p>I love Home Assistant. It's the best open-source home automation system there is. (And I've tried a few.) But you're probably not going to love it unless you're someone who enjoys tinkering.</p>
      <p>Sometimes the tinkering is fun. Other times, not so much. Last night I spent a few hours trying to fix my Z-Wave integration, which had vanished unexpectedly after my last round of updates. My Z-Wave JS add-on still worked, but I could no longer see its integration, and could no longer control my Z-Wave devices.</p>
<p>And that's the thing about Home Assistant: This kind of stuff sometimes happens. You've just gotta roll with it.</p>
<p>Searching online forums, I found a few instances of folks having the same problem, and some seeminlyg plausible theories of its cause (something to do with the USB bus), but no real solutions. I eventually discovered the J-Wave JS add-on has an MQTT Gateway option in its setting, which is disabled by default. Assuming you have an MQTT broker (like Mosquito) configured, which I did, you can just enable the Z-Wave MQTT Gateway; tweak its settings as needed; and then just control your Z-Wave devices via MQTT and get on with your life.</p><br clear="all">
 <h2>Different wireless technologies; different pros, cons</h2>
<p>My HA setup involves a hodgepodge of wireless technologies. Here's a rundown:</p>
<li><b>802.11 Wifi</b>: some Sonoff switches for lighting, and my irrigation controller. All my wifi IoT devices are Esperssif ESP8266-based, and all running Tasmota firmware.</li><br>
<li><b>RTL-SDR</b>: my swimming pool thermometer, which I wrote about the other day. It's an off-the-shelf La Crosse unit, but I was able to pick up its signal and integrate it into HA using the RTL_433 program and the HA RTL_433 add-on. If you manage to get an RTL-SDR stick up and running with HA, you'll likely pick up all kinds of interesting signals from neighboring weather sensors, alarms systems, and even utility metering devices. Most will be useless to you, but exploring them can be a good education in how commercial wireless gadgets communicate.</li><br>
<li><b>Zigbee</b>: I don't have much experience with Zigbee yet, but I'm loving it so far. I've got a few <a href="https://www.aqara.com/us/product/temperature-humidity-sensor/"><u>Aqara temperature and humidity sensors</u></a> and a couple <a href="https://3reality.com/product/smart-plug-gen2-with-energy-monitoring/"><u>THIRDREALITY smart plugs</u></a> (which also act as ZigBee network repeaters). They all work flawlessly. For my Zigbee gateway, I'm using a <a href="https://sonoff.tech/product/gateway-and-sensors/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus-e/"><u>Sonoff Zigbee 3.0 USB Dongle Plus</u></a>.</p>
