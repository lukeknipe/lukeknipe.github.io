      <p>I love Home Assistant. It's the best open-source home automation system there is. (And I've tried a few.) But you're probably not going to love it unless you're someone who enjoys tinkering.</p>
      <p>Sometimes the tinkering is fun. Sometimes not so much. Last night I spent a few hours trying to fix my Z-Wave integration, which quit working after my last round of updates. The Z-Wave JS add-on still worked, but I could no longer see its integration, and could no longer control my Z-Wave devices. Searching online forums, I found a few instances of folks having the same problem, and some seeminlyg plausible theories of its cause (something to do with the USB bus), but no real solutions. I eventually discovered the J-Wave JS add-on has an MQTT Gateway option in its setting, which is disabled by default. Assuming you have an MQTT broker (like Mosquito) configured, which I did, you can just enable the Z-Wave MQTT Gateway; tweak its settings as needed; and then just control your Z-Wave devices via MQTT and get on with your life.</p><br clear="all">
      <h2>Plenty of range, long battery life</h2>

      <p>My pool is about 80 feet from the spot inside my house where the remote display sits. The remote display has a little bar graph that shows signal strength on a scale of one bar to five. At 80 feet, with an exterior masonry wall between it and the pool thermometer, it shows five bars.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, there is no indicator on the remote display to show the battery condition of the transmitting unit. That would have been a nice feature. But three months along, the two disposable 'AA' batteries are powering the unit just fine.</p>
      <p>I was initially concerned about the LCD screen on the transmitting unit. LCD screens constantly exposed to direct sun never do well over the long haul, and I'll be surprised if this one is still readable a year from now. But as long as it continues to transmit, I'm not going to worry about its display. It's nice being able to glance at it while walking past the pool and be able to see the temp, but the main reason I wanted this was so I could see the pool temp from inside the house.</p><br clear="all">
      <h2>Transmits on 914.9MHz, can be made to work with Home Assistant</h2>

    <p>My favorite thing about this wireless thermometer is I can pull its data into my Home Assistant instance. Achieving this took some tinkering: I used an RTL-SDR dongle, plus <a href="https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433"><u>Benjamin Larsson's awesome RTL_433 program</u></a>, to capture the thermometer's signal and output it to my local network as MQTT. I also used <a href="https://github.com/pbkhrv/rtl_433-hass-addons/tree/main/rtl_433_mqtt_autodiscovery"><u>this great Home Assistant Add-on for RTL_433 users</u></a> that automatically discovers sensor data in the MQTT stream, making the data easy to use in your integrations. I'll try to write more on how to do this as soon as I get the chance.</p>
