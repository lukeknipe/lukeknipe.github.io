## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)


### What I learned

As a newbie to Frontend Mentor and something of a newbie to GitHub, I'm becoming better acquainted with both. This is my first time using GitHub's Markdown syntax, which is nice. I also have never used Sketch or Figma before. So for this project I used Sketch.

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to submitting this first solution and learning more with Frontend Mentor.

### Useful resources

- [Google, duh](https://www.google.com/) - The most useful resource of all. Can't remember a CSS property? Google it! Need a JavaScript function for a particular thing, and don't remember how to do it? Google to the rescue!
- [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) - An indispensable means of examining your code and what it's causing to happen (or not happen) in the browser.
