      <p>January 6, 2025</p>
      <p>A segment on <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech/episodes/1013?autostart=false"><u>the January 5, 2025 episode of This Week in Tech</u></a> alerted me to a phenomenon that seems to have triggered a groundswell of interest among journalists and media researchers: the appearance of <a href="https://theweek.com/tech/spotify-fake-bands"><u>fake recording artists</u></a> on online music services like Spotify and Apple Music.</p>
      <p>The discussion reminded me of an artist I discovered a few months ago: <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chris-shards/1451050410"><u><b>Chris Shards</b></u></a>. Shards is the artist on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqcuWrsbDJU"><u>a track called “Say it Again,”</u></a> which I first heard (and really liked) while watching a YouTube video that used it for background music.<p>Say it Again is a sparse, moody instrumental led by an electric guitar with some reverb and a phase shifter, which gives the whole track a vintage feel, as though it might be some famous artist's deep cut from the 1970s.</p>
      <p>But Shards is neither famous, nor an artist, nor apparently even a person. I can't tell if any of the instruments on Say it Again are real, although the guitar part certainly feels real. But a number of today's generative tools can mimic musicianship in convincing ways, and Shards' whole catalog might well be nothing more than that. Every Shards tune I could find on YouTube was included a phonographic copyright symbol ℗ and the statement "Provided to YouTube by Epidemic Sound."<br clear="all">
      <p>Still, I love the way Say it Again feels. It's evocative, sentimental, and mellow. And I'm not the only one: a raft of compliments appear in the comments of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqcuWrsbDJU"><u>a YouTube video of the song</u></a>, posted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EpidemicIndie"><u>a user account called “Epidemic Indie,”</u></a> which seems to be associated with other “artists” of similarly dubious origin. Redditor _bubba_fett <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blues/comments/z8e76w/help_finding_more_of_this_soundfeel_chris_shards/"><u>started a thread in r/blues, imploring others to help him find artists that sound like Shards</u></a>. He had discovered Shards via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR4pSWECxXA"><u>a tune called Always With You</u></a>; a slow blues ballad that sounds a little like Stevie Ray Vaughn. A chorus of similarly enamored Redditors soon chimed in: Subject_Register_499 said "i love the guy-huge mystery by design. I'd travel anywhere to here him live." [sic] Odd_Neighborhood3459 said "Chris, if you’re out there: we want more!"</p>

<p>While Say it Again's real creator—whomever or whatever that is—might not have touched a single real instrument in making the tune, it's hard to imagine some sort of human with real musical acumen wasn't involved. I don't like the idea that its origin is not what it seems, and I especially don't like that it appears to involve some deceit. But I still like the way it sounds.</p>
      <p>As to the question of whether a real Chris Shards exists, it doesn't seem likely. Real recording artists want to be noticed. They tend to have social media footprints; public-facing bios; publicity photos; and so on. The more fortunate among them tend to have record deals. Shards has none of these things. Shards' “cover art”—a necessity for songs and albums available on streaming services—is weird and bad in a way that seems to bely the quality of the music.</p>
    <p>If you are Chris Shards the recording artist and happen to be reading this, my apologies.</p>
    <p>If you are someone otherwise responsible for the Chris Shards recordings, and a Google alert led you here, I'd be delighted to hear from you via email. I'd very much like to learn more about what, exactly, is going on here. But I'm not gonna hold my breath.</p>
