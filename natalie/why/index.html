<p>As president of the TUSD Governing Board and as a parent, I want to continue the work I’ve begun. I will ensure that TUSD provides strong schools and equal opportunities for all our students. Education should always be among the top priorities of a thriving community.</p>
<p>As a Governing Board Member,</p>
<li>I supported a voter-approved $480M Bond package to beautify our campuses, install new HVAC systems, and provide safety upgrades to keep our kids and staff safe.</li>
<li>I voted in support of an increase to the minimum wage for all TUSD employees, passed $7500 in COVID relief stipends, and worked to ensure TUSD was competitive with salaries.</li>
<li>I supported investments in social workers and counselors, literacy and math support, a new Tucson Unified Virtual Academy (giving parents a remote learning option), and increased funding for fine arts and interscholastic equipment and facilities.</li>
<li>I believe all teachers and staff deserve a salary that reflects the time and dedication they have invested in our students.</li>
<li>I believe all students learn differently and should not be judged based on standardized tests.</li>
<li>I will advocate for the expansion of JTED programs and innovation for students in the 21st century.</li>
<li>I continued to support families with students with disabilities and the assurance that they are receiving their free and appropriate education under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).</li>
<li>I will advocate for better policies, sustainable funding, and strong public schools at the AZ State Legislature.</li>
<li>I support TUSD’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Programs, including student service departments, magnet schools, transportation, family outreach, curriculum, and extracurricular activities, are designed to fulfill this commitment.</li>
<li>I am committed to overseeing and keeping the district leadership focused on racial integration, academic achievement, and fair and just discipline policies for students of color. </li>
<li>I will continue making meaningful changes toward providing a healthy work environment for teachers and staff.</li>
<li>I will remain accessible to the community and represent us with integrity and transparency.</li>
<li>I am also committed to building public trust and ensuring financial transparency to assure the community that every student is receiving the highest-quality education and services possible.</li>
<li>I serve for our kids, our families, our educators, and our community.</li>
