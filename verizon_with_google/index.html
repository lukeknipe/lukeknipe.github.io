    <h1>How to set up Verizon 5G Home Internet with Google Wifi</h1>
    <p>November 9, 2023</p>
    <p>I recently had occasion to set up one of those new Verizon 5G Home Internet cubes as internet gateway for a Google Wifi network. A bit of googling turned up scant information on how to do this, and some of the information I found was bad. But I figured it out on my own. This is a simple set of instructions for anyone in the same situation.</p>
    <p>You're going to want to locate your Verizon Cube close enough to one of your Google Wifi pucks to connect the two with a short ethernet patch cable.</p>
    <h2>Step One</h2>
    <p>Disconnect both your cube and your puck from power. (It's fine to leave the other pucks running.)</p>
