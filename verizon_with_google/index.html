    <h1>How to set up Verizon 5G Home Internet with Google Wifi</h1>
    <p>November 9, 2023</p>
    <p>I recently had occasion to set up one of those new Verizon 5G Home Internet cubes as internet gateway for a Google Wifi network. A bit of googling turned up scant information on how to do this, and some of the information out there is bad. I had to figure it out on my own. This is a simple tutorial for anyone in the same situationâ€”a category that might even include me at some later date.</p>
